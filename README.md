# **mon-cheri**
## Printable crimps braided cable simps.
`mon-cheri` are open-source, printed crimps to keep bicycle brake and shifter cable ends from fraying. They look neat, are easy to grip and removable for maintenaince. 

## Two screw sizes, one cable size, many shapes
`mon-cheri` comes in a few shapes.
- **tri** - a triangle
- **ball** - a small round
- **barrel** - a puck-shaped
- **square** - `coming soon`
- **heart** - `coming soon`

Each shape is provided in M3 and M4 sizes. 

M3 allows some shapes be a bit smaller (lighter!) but the threads are delicate, and the hex wrench size is *rare*.

M4 is a more common hex wrench size to carry, and makes everythin a bit more robust.

Every `mon-cheri` should fit typical brake and shifter cables of all sorts.

### Recommended grub screw lengths

| Style  | tri      | ball     | barrel   |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| **M3** | 4 mm     | 5 mm     | 5 mm     |
| **M4** | 5 - 6 mm | 3.5-4 mm | 3.5-4 mm |


## Instructions
1. You'll need a short grub (headless) screw
1. Print in a tough, outdoor-friendly filament like PETG
   1. Use at least 2 perimeters. They're so small infill doesn't make much of a difference.
1. Use a poker to bore out the cable hole to clear any stringing
1. Thread in the grub screw - keep it straight!
1. Place it on the end of a cleanly cut cable
1. Tighten down to a reasonable tension - *not too tight!*
1. Ride your bike!
1. Next time you need to remove the cables or make adjustments, just loosen up and repeat. 



## Source files
This project is created using FreeCAD -  a free and open source program. Design source files are available and accessible in this repository.

You can make adjustments to most parameters that drive the model, and so long as they're reasonable it should not break! This can be useful if your grub screws are a tight or loose fit, or if you'd like to create a larger size.
